# Stochastic Analysis of the "Gambler's Ruin" Problem

This folder contains the original materials developed for the university project focused on stochastic processes and Random Walk models.

### Contents:
* **Gambler_s_Ruin.pdf**: theoretical research paper investigating an "unfair game" scenario ($p=0.48$) with absorbing barriers.
* **Project.R**: initial R script employing Monte Carlo methods to analyze capital trajectories and game duration.

### Key academic findings:
* Successfully validated the theoretical ruin probability of **98.21%** against an empirical result of **98.8%**.
* Identified a critical phase transition at $p=0.5$, demonstrating how minor probability shifts radically alter long-term outcomes.
* Confirmed that in sub-fair environments ($p < 0.5$), aggressive betting strategies minimize the risk of ruin by reducing game duration.
